## Basic Info

Hi there 🥝, I am AshGrey (github username AshGreyG is just for avoiding 
duplicate with an existing username), you can call me Grey He, or 何昱晖 in Chinese.
+ 🍊 [懐尓](https://github.com/huaier007). She is my best friend, my girlfriend, 
  my wife and my soulmate. She is the eternal spring in my life.
+ 🫐 I have a [personal website](https://www.huaier-ashgrey.top), where my notes 
  and resume are hosted.
+ 🌽 I am still studying in Tsinghua University, a second-year undergraduate 
  (possibly I will never graduate) in the 
  [School of Pharmaceutical Science](https://www.sps.tsinghua.edu.cn/spsen/). 
  I hate school-learning.
+ 🥦 I am really interested in all the subjects that have abstract knowledge. Such 
  as CS, Math and Physics. I extremely love coding, and purchase high-quality code.
